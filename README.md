Redflags is a game that emulates the style of popular party games like Kahoot and Jackbox, but it is based on the game Redflags. It is a web-based game where players can engage in a fun and interactive experience using their own lists of flags and perk cards. The project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic and engaging user interface.

## Gameplay

[![Red flags instrucitonal video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hv-CRldHSHw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv-CRldHSHw "Welcome to Red Flags!")

Here's how it works: one player takes on the role of the "single," and the rest of the group uses perk cards to create what they think would be the perfect date for them. for exaxmple, an "honest person who loves dogs" or an "Astronaut who is also the President!". Then, everyone gets to play a red flag card that introduces a flaw to one of these ideal dates. The dates now come with drawbacks such as "Only speaks in business buzzwords," "Is a hobbit," or "First name is 'Poop'." With these less-than-ideal matches in play, players must now try to convince the single to go on a date with their creation. The game can be as wild or tame as your creativity allows!
